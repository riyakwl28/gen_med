According to the FDA, “A generic drug is identical -- or bioequivalent -- to a brand name drug in dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.”Our product aims to suggest generic medicines from the medicines prescribed by the doctor.It will also warn against consumption of certain food items with respect to the medicine being taken.Connecting with the location of the patient it will also suggest the possible pharmacies from where the suggested medicines can be bought. IMPLEMENTATION:We will be using compter vision algos to identify the name of the medicine from the photo of the medicine cover. Alternatively the user can enter the name of the medicine, whose generic suggestion he needs. A photo of the prescription can also be used to identify the medicines for the user. The name will be matched against those, in our database, and a list of generic medicines will be suggested. The app will be using GPS to track the users realtime location and use Google Maps to suggest nearmy medicine shops which have the suggested medicines in stock.A database connecting to the database of the shopkeepers will be kept,that will suggest to the user the shop selling the medicine at minimum price. After suggesting the medicine side-efects, do's and don't, dose and where that medicine is commonly used, will be displayed
